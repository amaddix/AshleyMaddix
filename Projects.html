          <h3> Vehicle/person Classifier </h3>
          <p>The purpose of this project is to create an image classifier that can distinguish cars and people in images with an accuracy of > 95%. This entailed creating a new dataset and training a new classifier. The dataset consists of images from existing datasets and royalty free videos. The team also sourced content from videos we took ourselves. We were able to obtain 5,091 images through the course of development. We went for a brute force-like approach for testing. Starting with epochs, we would try many values over a range. Taking the best results from that test, we would try each of them with a range of learning rate values and take the best runs from those tests. This process was repeated for each setting until we were satisfied with the results. By the end the team ran over 1,200 tests. We were not able to reach the goal of a classifier with an accuracy of 95%, our best performing model had an accuracy of 65%. The size and diversity of the dataset held us back and there was likely some overfitting to the training data. Switching to a 3 class model from a 4 class yielded a good performance boost but some of that was likely superficial. By developing this model we were able to create situations that exposed bugs in the software that utilized the classifier.

          <h3> Joi Ride </h3>
          <p>The app we made for this class, Joi Ride, was intended to help those going on a road trip or a vacation. It would ideally take a starting address and destination address to help the user determine where to go along their trip. The user would have options for the radius of their search, and various keywords to filter their type of establishment the search results display. 


            As far as the overall goal of this application, I think we accomplished the main points. Joi Ride does successfully retrieve a starting and ending address and displays the route from point A and B. Additionally, we were able to implement an autocomplete functionality for the address input, to help users enter a correct address. The site also displays the step by step directions, which wasn't in the original plan but a helpful addition for the users. As another bonus we are able to retrieve the location of the user, so that the map is centered on their current location.
